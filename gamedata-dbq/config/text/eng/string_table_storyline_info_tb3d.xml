		<text>Not sure what happened in Dead City but now I am back in Cordon. I have no idea what to do next but seem to have a sense of urgency.\nThere is still something undone here..  like energy building up all around me. I need to see Sid and get the latest on what is happening in the Zone..</text>

		<text>Well, Sid and Tweed know each other, go figure. I have been given a sniper rifle and ammo from Sid to give to Tweed. This should help her fight off the military that keeps trying to move in there.</text>

		<text>Darkscape turned up a document that may be about what the stranger is looking for. It seems that this man is a well educated scientist and is looking for something very important. It also appears that I am part of his search yet I haven't a clue why. I will follow him into the Wasted Woodland to try and discover what it is he is looking for.</text>

		<text>Voronin is a total nut job at this point and any thing I get from him has gotta be worthless!\nI have no idea where to find these codes now, should see what Petrenko and maybe Ivancov know..</text>

	<string id="tb3d_zep5_article">
		<text>Petrenko said that Voronin chased 'AX' into the Wild Territory. He also described his faction patch to me: Helix over a silver cloud with a small round symbol not unlike a radiation warning sign. Who can that be? Where is he from and why the Hell is he after me..</text>

	<string id="tb3d_tunnels_desc">
		<text>Intel has been gathered that describes the strange portals that can be activated by dropping specific gold bars in their proper slots.\nEach bar has a code that indicates which slot it belongs to. The sequence appears to be:\nws-6,wn-5,ws-3,wn-2,es-6,es-4,en-3,es-2,n-0,s-0,center.\n.\nThe center slots can be identified by the large valve hanging overhead. Activation of the portals has never been done so the consequences of doing so are unknown.\n.\nInformation gathered by the AX scientific teams has produced a list of the portal targets that should be activated:\nWS6 - Marshes\nWN5 - Facility F1\nWS3 - Cordon\nWN2 - Broken Road\nES6 - Darkscape\nES4 - Black Market\nEN3 - Generators\nES2 - NPP North\nN00 - Waiting Room\nS00 - Recon</text>

		<text>Unknown operative: Agent X or also reffered to as 'AX'. His team is apperantly looking for research material and objects being worked on when the Zone first errupted.\nData collected so far indicates that he is searching for a particular person who was known to be at the NPP when it happened. He has been asking about a man with the tattoo 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R.' on his arm and is considered to be extremely ruthless in getting answers.</text>

		<text>Trail for 'AX' has gone cold. Messages about some raid happening from the North. Vaugue information about a secret underground lab and a WORKING Alien object.\nA message from Max in the Radar about the Cube which I need to check out immediately!\nSeems like a good time to go South and see what is happening at the bar in Rostok and maybe check on Tweed as well.</text>

		<text>Tweed is a want to be trader in the Darkscape region. She has asked me to find her lost book: For Women With an Adventurous Notion to Explore the Zone, by L. D. Tweed.\nIt should be somewhere around the old bar far to the Northeast.</text>

	<string id="zep_purged_tunnel">
		<text>Well that was fun..   not sure exactly what they were here for as there is nothing in the Distribution Center. I should go back and tell Karina that the tunnel is clear. Looks like I should pass through the Generators to get to the old research station where it looks like 'AX' was messing with the comm center there.</text>

	<string id="tb3d_treasure_hunt_entry">
		<text>Sid talked about a man that wandered the Zone collecting rare artifacts and some other items. Supposedly the man was hanging around the old red house all the time looking for something.\nSid suggested that I might search around there as he may have left something behind.</text>

	<string id="tb3d_hunt0_entry">
		<text>STALKER .. once you read this .. it means that I may already be dead. This all started when I was on a job near the Radar for the Initiative. They wanted me to find a couple of 'rare' artifacts that can only be found up there. I found myself hiding for my life from those Monolith freaks. I ducked down behind some bushes, and found myself enveloped in a thick dense fog that seemed to suddenly form out of nothing. It only enveloped me for a few seconds, my Geiger counter and anomaly detector went wild, and I felt very strange .. the rest .. well, I lost consciousness... I woke up feeling fine, and somewhat rejuvenated. Some time later, I began to notice something .. I could sense nearby artifacts. And then it started .. I found the Artefracts for each order with ease. I made it to the Chernobyl NPP but I could not find the Sarcophagus.  I did manage to gather a lot of rare unknown artifacts and unusual mutations of mushrooms. The Mushrooms are very interesting as these have very high levels of Caesium-137, strontium-90, barium-137, Iodine-131, tellurium and rubidium isotopes, plutonium and other heavy elements - all naturally absorbed, a characteristic of mushrooms.\n Each time I came back to the Cordon, I left well concealed caches in the areas I traveled through as well as notes with hints of other locations. With my fading health and memory I knew these cryptic clues would be needed.  With each passing day, the cumulative affects of CS-134 and other radioactive isotopes are quickly bringing me to my demise. Each time I look at my reflection I am significantly older. Only a few months after that incident at the Radar, my life is at an end.\nBut lucky for you .. you found my last note. Good luck to you STALKER, in pursuit of my treasures.\n.\nSo I'm not sure if he is gone or if more treasures are out there... will need to have a look when in those areas.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tb3d_hunt1_entry">
		<text>After a difficult search I have been able to find Caesier's treasure stashes as far as the Radar.\nIt puzzles me as to why he went for so many portals! He must have been a real paranoic!\nThe trail ends abruptly here so not sure if he is gone or if more treasures are out there..\nI will keep my eyes and ears open for any clues during my travels.</text>

<string id="levelup2_desolation_entry">
	<text>After destroying the strange generator in the Secret Lab, I ended up in Jupiter, in the underground complex. I must have caused the storm raging around the NPP which appears to have affected: the NPP, Radar, Dead City, East Pripyat, RECON, Warehouses, Generators, Black Market and the old cemetery. Warnings have gone out to stay out of those areas due to high radiation. The undergrounds in those areas are said to be safe but there has been no confirmation to that.</text>
</string>

<string id="levelup3_reclemation_entry">
	<text>Storm has dissipated and now it seems every faction wants to get there first...   but what did the storm do to that area of the Zone and can it be dealt with?\nAre the possible treasures there worth the risk? Sure as Hell I'm going to find out, and soon!\n BUT.. I need to plan my way back to the center to avoid enemies and discover what new perils are lurking out there..</text>
