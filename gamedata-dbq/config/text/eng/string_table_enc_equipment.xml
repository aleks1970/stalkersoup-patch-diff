		<text>You will need several things to successfully transmutate an artefact: \n 1. a Recipe - You must have the recipe for the artifact you're trying to transmute.\n 2. Correct Anomaly - Dropping an artefact in the wrong anomaly won't do anything at all. (See the Encyclopedia of anomalies with descriptions in order to identify the right type)\n 3. Correct artefact - Dropping the wrong type of artefact will also get you nowhere.\n 4. Correct time of day - It must be night time (between 18:00 pm and 06:00) for you to start artefact transmutation. As long as you START before 06:00 am it will work - it doesn't need to finish before 06:00 am ... \n\n For example: you have the recipe for the "Skin" and you want to make it. Look up the "Skin" artefact on the chart and notice the entries under the "Parent artefact", "Parent anomaly", and "Time" headings. Basically, what this means is that if you want to make a "Skin" artefact, open up your inventory and drop a "Pellicle" into a Springboard anomaly and wait four (4) hours. You'll see a bright flash of white light for a second letting you know that the anomaly has accepted the artifact for transmutation ... there you have it.</text>

		<text>A Portable psi-antenna developed as part of the "About-Consciousness" program, and used for experiments regarding the effects of radiation on live organisms. The aerial's current generates not only psi-energy, but possesses an hallucinogenic effect as well. But, its most significant quality - the ability to teleport mutants. To switch off such an aerial without any special means of psi/radiation protection is practically suicidal. It has an effective radius of up to 70 meters</text>

		<text>Plastic explosive (or plastique) is a specialised form of explosive material. It is soft and hand moldable solid material. Plastic explosives are properly known as putty explosives within the field of explosives engineering. Common plastic explosives include Semtex and C-4. Plastic explosives are especially suited for explosive demolition as they can be easily formed into the best shapes for cutting structural members, and have a high enough velocity of detonation and density for metal cutting work. They are generally not used for ordinary blasting as they tend to be significantly more expensive than other materials that perform just as well in that field. Also, when an explosive is combined with a plasticizer, its power is generally lower than when it is pure.</text>
