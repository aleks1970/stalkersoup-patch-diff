        <text>Dead City</text>
    </string>
	<string id="enc_zone_locations_deadcity">
		<text>Located only two kilometers from the Army Warehouses, this is a small town in the West of the Zone that has come to be known as the Dead City. It was completely destroyed during the Second World War only to be completely reconstructed in 1983. Many employees of the Agroprom Research Institute used to live there. In 2009, it became a haven for Mercenary Groups, but the Freedom Faction claims it to be their own as well, which has lead to constant conflict between the two in the past ... Just recently, however they have come to an agreement, and were united into a single Clan with a single, solitary purpose: To keep all others out of the Dead City at all costs!!! ... This makes it an extremely dangerous area ...</text>

        <text>Limansk</text>
    </string>
	<string id="enc_zone_locations_limansk">
		<text>The abandoned city that has been taken over by the Monolith faction, and which also finds itself a safe haven for Bandits. There is a myth surrounding Limansk that tells of it's mysterious ability to disappear off the map entirely, only to suddenly re-appear again at any given moment. A rumour that has never been proven to be either false, nor true in nature. It is possible to get there from the Red Forest, but the gates are protected by both Monolithians as well as Bandits.</text>

    </string>
	<string id="enc_zone_locations_darklab">
        <text>One of the first Genetic Experimentation Laboratories to surface inside the Zone - Carries the code name X-18. It was constructed in early 2001, and resides somewhere in the Dark Valley region. According to all available information on this horrid place, the Lab's entrance is to be found somewhere in a cellar of the long-abandoned factory.</text>

        <text>Laboratory X-16</text>
    </string>
	<string id="enc_zone_locations_brainlab">
        <text>Laboratory X-16 is a very enigmatic facility. Scientists claim that there is a certain "Psychological Danger" to be found in the area, of which any details have yet to officially surface. The Factory Complex is rumored to house the source of these Psi-Emissions. To go there without some form of psi-protection is highly discouraged, and certainly not recommended.</text>

	<string id="enc_zone_locations_labx10">
        <text>Experienced S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s tell tales of this laboratory ( Code named X-10 ), but no-one has ever claimed to have been inside its thick, fortress-like walls. This massive bunker is located in the vicinity of the fabled Radar District north of the Red Forest. As it is heavily fortified, and under constant watch by the Monolith faction, no-one dares to even attempt entry. The area is rumoured to be extremely dangerous, with high radiation levels.</text>

	<string id="enc_zone_locations_warlab">
        <text>Former underground Military Laboratory ( X-8 ) which supposedly supplied some sort of indiscernible power supply to certain suspicious looking generators on the surface. Rumour has it that the army Scientists working there were involved in a project called the "C-Consciousness" ... but there was a an incident involving the failure of one of the transmitters leading to a massive explosion which killed everyone on sight. After this disastrous incident the location became simply referred to as "The Military Lab"</text>

	<string id="enc_zone_locations_zaton">
        <text>Large district located to the east of the NPP, once called Zaton. It lies across the dried up river containing the rusted hulks of abandoned sea-vessels. To the south-east, the Preobrazhenskiy bridge spans the river, and in the west .. the large circular "Crystal Oscillators". In the center of this district there is a ship - "Skadovsk". Some industrious S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s have converted it into a drinking establishment servicing the nearby settlement of "Emerald", which is not a recommended destination due to rising radiation levels and the continuously rising population of dangerous mutants.</text>

        <text>The only place of interest - a factory, located in the south-east. In its center, a railway station named "Jani". Just off to the side lies the big strip-mine in which the lowlands spread out towards Letnik. The Concrete Factory to the north has long since been abandoned. Stories are told of a visible white light eminating from the factory at night. A group of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s went to investigate ... none of which have been seen since.</text>

	<string id="enc_zone_locations_predbannik">
        <text>This strange part of the Zone serves as a sort of 'vestibule' between the Perimeter, and the Outside World. This territory contains a small accumulation of anomalies, and is sparsely populated by Mutants. The background radiation here can exceed the allowable level from ten to twenty times, making it very dangerous. In the North-East, there is a settlement, where you can find a Bar, as well as a local Merchant. To the South, on a hill overlooking the NPP, there have been reported Bloodsucker sightings. A village lies in the South-West, and an abandoned Military Base lies in the Center. The road leads to the Checkpoint ... beyond which the Waiting Room area ends ...</text>

    </string>
	    <string id="enc_Swamp_thing">
        <text>Wandering throughout the twisting, windy paths within the area surrounding the Swamps without caution it is possible to encounter this very dangerous creature. A sub-species of the common "Bloodsucker", its habits and physical appearance differ from its overland cousin somewhat. Possessing perfectly developed muscles, it is capable of making enormous leaps in striking unwitting S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s to the ground with its enourmous claws, and then dragging them into the swamps. No-one that has ever had the misfortune to encounter this beast has ever returned to tell the tale. Capable of becoming invisible, it attacks unexpectedly, and without warning. Even when not cloaked they are nearly impossible to see because of their naturally camouflaged dark skinned bodies, and overall slimy appearance.

	    <string id="enc_Psi_dog">
		<text>Having inherited several distinctive characteristics of the common pseudo-dog, this creature makes its den close to strong sources of psi-radiation. The most notable thing about this creature is its phsycic ability to communicate neurally with a series of "Spectral Clones" that repeat its own behaviours. These clones pose just as much danger as the commanding Psi-Dog, and as they do not have a physical form of their own ... prove themselves invulnerable to direct physical attacks. Visually they differ as well... sporting lighter coloured, and rigid fur. Typically they are to be found primarily in the northern reaches of the Zone, and are considered to be extremely dangerous!!!

	    <string id="enc_Psi_burer">
		<text>The sad, sadistic result of the genetic experiments conducted by Army Special Forces Scientists on Death-Row criminals as part of the "Program of Progress in the form of Telekinetic Capacities" aka "PPTC". This is all that remains of an essentially humanoid creature, with extremely hyper-trophied features. They tend to avoid sources of light, therefore choosing to dwell only in dark, gloomy vaults and caves. In close combat, they tend to attack through the use of gravitational force - which repels their opponent(s) with such force as to cause serious physical damage both internally as well as externally. They are also capable of levitating heavy objects, and using them as weapons in the form of a flying projectile attack. They can pull the weapon from your very hands, using their directional gravitational impulse abilities. The best defense against such a creature is to remain in constant motion, and not to venture too close so as too avoid its pssychological onslaughts. They have been found to be vulnerable to gunfire ... particularly when inflicted to the head. They have been known to feed upon the corpses of dead S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s ...

	<string id="enc_history_bibliotekar">
		<text>In Pripyat, under the library, there was a clandestine Laboratory that specialized in Animal Experimentation. Particularly on Gorrillas. There was an accident took place there even before the second Zone incident of 2006. From the official transcript taken from a tape recording of a statement from Special Forces operative Gustavo Marakina: "... I heard the alarm signal, and went to investigate. Upon entering the main hall just outside the Research Library, I very nearly dropped my weapon and ran for my life ... at least seven Scientific staff members lay on the floor there covered in blood, and completely torn to pieces!!! From further down the corridor I could hear heavy, plodding footsteps ... coming closer ... closer ... then, as if in an instant it was there ... it was just under two meters in height, round-shouldered, extremely hairy ... reminded me of a giant ape or gorrilla. It howled a horrible, sad bellowing noise at me ... and I turned for the main entrance, and ran as fast as I could ... never looking back ... I could feel it chasing after me ... taunting me with it's cries. I made it to the Exit opened the coded security door... and just kept on running ... never looking back!!! I know now, my mistake ... of not closing the door ... sealing the Exit behind me ... locking this ... this ... "Thing" in there forever ... but, I cannot change the past ... and I must live with it for the rest of my natural life ....  "sobbing sound" ...</text>

	</string>
	<string id="enc_pogremushka_infa_to_pda">
		<text>I am copying this data into your PDA so that you do not forget this very important piece of information. It goes like this: I wandered into some caves with an associate of mine known locally as 'the Labyrinth'. So, at the very deepest end of it, we were attacked by Rats. A lot of fucking Rats. Filthy, disease ridden creatures!!! We ran away as fast as we could until, eventually we fell into what appeared to be a large cavern. We climbed onto a ledge, and from there began to shoot back at the Rats ... they just seemed to keep coming .. more, and more of them .. multiplying!! I had a strange Artefact on my belt known as a 'Simbion' ... All of a sudden, my buddy grabs it, and jumps into the oncoming throng of Rats ... unbelieveable!! At this point, some sort of anomaly began to form where he had landed .. first, it was invisible ... and then, a bright, white flash ... then, I lost consciousness ... When I came to .. I could see the Artefact in front of me .. surrounded by a pile of dead Rats .. all of them dead!!! and lying in the pile was the skeleton of my dead Associate, Zhal ...  He was a good person. Not corrupt like most. I miss him dearly .. and will never be able to repay his sacrifice on that day .. As it turns out, the 'Simbion' artefact is the result of a transmutation involving 'Fruitpunch' anomaly. You must throw a raw 'Simbion' into it, and about ten minutes later ... it produces a new Artefact known as 'Rattle' ... because of its shape. There is nothing more I can tell you ... take this information, and use it well ... Good Luck.</text>
