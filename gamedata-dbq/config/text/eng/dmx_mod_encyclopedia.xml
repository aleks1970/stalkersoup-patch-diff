	<string id="enc_zone_locations_deadcity">
		<text>Located only two kilometers from the Army Warehouses, this is a small town in the West of the Zone that has come to be known as the Dead City. It was completely destroyed during the Second World War only to be completely reconstructed in 1983. Many employees of the Agroprom Research Institute used to live there. In 2009, it became a haven for Mercenary Groups, but the Freedom Faction claims it to be their own as well, which has lead to constant conflict between the two in the past ... Just recently, however they have come to an agreement, and were united into a single Clan with a single, solitary purpose: To keep all others out of the Dead City at all costs!!! ... This makes it an extremely dangerous area ...</text>

There is a myth surrounding Limansk that tells of it's mysterious ability to disappear off the map entirely, only to suddenly re-appear again at any given moment. A rumour that has never been proven to be either false, nor true in nature. It is possible to get there from the Red Forest, but the gates are protected by both Monolithians as well as Bandits.</text>

Some industrious S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s have converted it into a drinking establishment servicing the nearby settlement of "Emerald", which is not a recommended destination due to rising radiation levels and the continuously rising population of dangerous mutants.</text>

In the North-East, there is a settlement, where you can find a Bar, as well as a local Merchant. To the South, on a hill overlooking the NPP, there have been reported Bloodsucker sightings. A village lies in the South-West, and an abandoned Military Base lies in the Center. The road leads to the Checkpoint ... beyond which the Waiting Room area ends ...</text>

No-one that has ever had the misfortune to encounter this beast has ever returned to tell the tale. Capable of becoming invisible, it attacks unexpectedly, and without warning.

This is all that remains of an essentially humanoid creature, with extremely hyper-trophied features. They tend to avoid sources of light, therefore choosing to dwell only in dark, gloomy vaults and caves. In close combat, they tend to attack through the use of gravitational force - which repels their opponent(s) with such force as to cause serious physical damage both internally as well as externally. They are also capable of levitating heavy objects, and using them as weapons in the form of a flying projectile attack. They can pull the weapon from your very hands, using their directional gravitational impulse abilities. The best defense against such a creature is to remain in constant motion, and not to venture too close so as too avoid its pssychological onslaughts. They have been found to be vulnerable to gunfire ... particularly when inflicted to the head.

From the official transcript taken from a tape recording of a statement from Special Forces operative Gustavo Marakina: "... I heard the alarm signal, and went to investigate. Upon entering the main hall just outside the Research Library, I very nearly dropped my weapon and ran for my life ... at least seven Scientific staff members lay on the floor there covered in blood, and completely torn to pieces!!! From further down the corridor I could hear heavy, plodding footsteps ... coming closer ... closer ... then, as if in an instant it was there ... it was just under two meters in height, round-shouldered, extremely hairy ... reminded me of a giant ape or gorrilla. It howled a horrible, sad bellowing noise at me ... and I turned for the main entrance, and ran as fast as I could ... never looking back ... I could feel it chasing after me ... taunting me with it's cries. I made it to the Exit opened the coded security door... and just kept on running ... never looking back!!!

		<text>I am copying this data into your PDA so that you do not forget this very important piece of information. It goes like this: I wandered into some caves with an associate of mine known locally as 'the Labyrinth'. So, at the very deepest end of it, we were attacked by Rats. A lot of fucking Rats. Filthy, disease ridden creatures!!! We ran away as fast as we could until, eventually we fell into what appeared to be a large cavern. We climbed onto a ledge, and from there began to shoot back at the Rats ... they just seemed to keep coming .. more, and more of them .. multiplying!! I had a strange Artefact on my belt known as a 'Simbion' ... All of a sudden, my buddy grabs it, and jumps into the oncoming throng of Rats ... unbelieveable!! At this point, some sort of anomaly began to form where he had landed .. first, it was invisible ... and then, a bright, white flash ... then, I lost consciousness ... When I came to .. I could see the Artefact in front of me .. surrounded by a pile of dead Rats .. all of them dead!!! and lying in the pile was the skeleton of my dead Associate, Zhal ...  He was a good person. Not corrupt like most. I miss him dearly .. and will never be able to repay his sacrifice on that day .. As it turns out, the 'Simbion' artefact is the result of a transmutation involving 'Fruitpunch' anomaly. You must throw a raw 'Simbion' into it, and about ten minutes later ... it produces a new Artefact known as 'Rattle' ... because of its shape. There is nothing more I can tell you ... take this information, and use it well ... Good Luck.</text>
