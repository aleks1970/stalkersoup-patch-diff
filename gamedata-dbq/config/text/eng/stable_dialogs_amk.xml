	<string id="artem_kulinar_0">
		<text>Welcome! I have a few things on offer, interested? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_1">
		  <text>Well look here, you have organised a damn snack Bar. TO bad its so damn close to radioactive heaps of dust.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_2">
		<text>For some people the Dump is a hard place to reach and I congratulate you on that! It will most likely be forgotten quickly though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_3">
		<text>Does it make any sense to you? Not far from here is a Bar that buys loot and sells better weapons. While over here, we have bandits and all sorts of scum with checkpoints that will take your money.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_4">
		<text>Over there in the Bar people are serious and can easily get angry so I warn you not to make a fuss. While the Dump is a place where the rookies find out if they can handle the zone. Fighting Gangsters HA! this is not real combat. They need a few of us old hands to teach them a few things, but the ones that arnt gonna make it die within a week. Step into an anomaly or become mutant food.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_5">
		<text>All right I heard enough about the rookies. Where are you from?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_6">
		<text>I was brought up in the forest. I traveled around Europe working as a cook. The leftover food was given to cats and dogs while the homeless were walking around the streets hungry! While here in the Zone how many dogs and cats starve? Not many, as most rookies become a meal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_7">
		<text>Who do I speak with around here concerning weapons and ammo?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_8">
		<text>You want to talk to Vityok Voron. He is a very mysterious person.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_9">
		<text>Tell me more about this mysterious person.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_10">
		<text>Want to know what is comfortable here in the Zone? Ravens. If they have one talent among them its they know where death is most likley to happen and they will fly above waiting for fresh corpses. That is how Vityok got the nickname of Raven, attracted to the death and profits of these rookies in the garbage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artem_kulinar_11">
		<text>Everything is now clear to me. Thank you for telling me what you know of the Raven.</text>
	</string>
	<!-- dialogue with Vitko the Raven -->
	<string id="vitek_voron_0">
		<text>What is it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vitek_voron_1">
		<text>Greetings, this is a nice place, wouldn't you agree?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vitek_voron_2">
		<text>This place is just right for what I call home.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vitek_voron_3">
		<text>Ive been looking around for you. You aren't an easy person to find, yet here you are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vitek_voron_4">
		<text>Im here to do business and I prefer business to words if you understand me. What keeps me in business? its my weapon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vitek_voron_5">
		<text>Sort of attitude one needs in the Zone</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vitek_voron_6">
		<text>I dont know you and you dont know me so there will be no discounts here on my goods okay?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vitek_voron_7">
		<text>Lets drop the small talk and get down to business, what do you offer?</text>
