Extremely rare because of it's large size and weight. Requires the use of Exoskeleton armour due to it's large size, as it must be strapped on, and attached to the users armour. \nThe original PK Pulemyot Kalashnikova or Kalashnikovs Machinegun was a development of Kalashnikovs automatic rifle design, firing the 7.62x54mmR Eastern Bloc standard ammunition originally from the Mosin-Nagant. It is equipped with a simple bipod and is designed as a squad-level support weapon; it is also suitable for installation and vehicle mounting. The PK machine gun can be used as a light anti-aircraft weapon when it is put on an AA mount. Most are belt-fed, using linked 25 round belts. These 25-round belts can be linked to any length necessary. Typical of Soviet machine guns, the standard model feeds from the right and ejects it's spent cases via an ejection port on the left side of the weapon, contrary to the right side ejection port seen in most Western machine guns.\nThe PKM Kalashnikovs Machine-gun Modernized is the current model. It is a modernized, product-improved version of the PK weighing only 7.5 kg without ammunition</text>

The P90s name is an abbreviation of FNs Project 9.0 - the weapon was created in response to NATO requests for a replacement for 9x19mm Parabellum firearms. It was designed as a compact but powerful firearm for vehicle drivers, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces and counter-terrorist groups. The P90 has a futuristic appearance. It features a compact bullpup design and ambidextrous controls, and incorporates several innovations such as the top-mounted magazine and FNs high velocity 5.7x28mm ammunition. The P90 was developed between 1986 and 1990. A P90 TR variant was then introduced in 1999, featuring a triple rail interface system for mounting accessories. Since 2005, the P90 has also been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90, a semi-automatic sporting model with a lengthened barrel</text>
