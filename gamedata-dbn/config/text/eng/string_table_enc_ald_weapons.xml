		The UMP "Taktikal" is a blowback-operated , magazine-fed submachine gun with integrated silencer and eotech scope,
		firing from a closed bolt. As originally designed, the UMP is chambered for larger cartridges and magazines than other submachine guns like the MP5, 
		to provide more stopping power against unarmored targets (with a slightly lower effective range) than the 9x19mm MP5 provides.
		A larger cartridge produces more recoil, and makes control more difficult in fully automatic firing. To mitigate this, is equiped with larger magazine.
		the cyclic rate of fire was improved to 700 rounds/min (600 rounds/min for the UMP45).</text>
