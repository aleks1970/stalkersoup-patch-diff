After a moment of dead silence there came rattling thunder, and then the earth shook. People fell to the ground, screwing up their eyes and covering their ears. Those who could still stand ran for their lives. It looked as though all the nuclear fuel buried under the Sarcophagus had suddenly exploded. The next day the Army cordoned off the new Zone..\nThe satellites helped to establish that the epicenter of the explosion was not actually in the vicinity of the NPP reactors, but about half a kilometer away. It is believed that the personnel employed at the Station died instantly...\nThough many people still remained within the cordoned area. The rescue operation soon proved a pointless endeavor, as all the people and machinery sent deep into the area would die or malfunction immediately. A little while after the disaster, the Zone diameter hopped out by a few more kilometers. Most of the government troops guarding the border line and the research teams stationed there perished instantly. Panic stricken, people took to flight. The residents of nearby towns and villages were hastily evacuated. An enormous danger is looming over the world and we can only guess what its full impact may be...</text>

		<text> Ammunition: 9x18mm, 9x18mm +P\nThis interesting submachine gun had been developed in Izhevsk at the famous IZHMASH state arms factory during the early 1990's, and first appeared in public circa 1993. Obviously influenced by the somewhat unsuccessful Calico submachine guns, the Bizon (Bison) SMG combined a high capacity "helical" magazine with a more conventional appearance and layout. The Bizon is based on the AKS-74 assault rifle, and actually built on shortened AKS-74 receivers, with the AKS-74 pistol grip, trigger unit and folding butt. Latter models introduced a somewhat improved shape of the pistol grip, with better ergonomics. The large capacity magazine is located under the barrel, and serves as a forearm, resulting in a comfortable hold and trim profile. This firearm is said to be both comfortable to carry and easy to fire, and provides lots of firepower.</text>

The blowback action is buffered to provide stability during firing. About 60 per cent of the parts used in the Bizon are taken from other Kalashnikov models, mainly from the AK-74 series, including the left-folding butt-stock, the trigger mechanism and the receiver cover. There is a choice of folding-butt contours and types.The helical-feed magazine holds 64 rounds, although this may be increased. To fit the magazine, two lugs at the forward end protrude over two pins under the muzzle attachment.
