		<text>OK, Here's the deal. This time you won and became the champion of the Arena, but that's not a permanent title and it doesn't give any guarantee that you won't win your way into a box in the next tournament. Tournaments are arranged more-or-less regularly. Once or twice daily. Matches happen from 22:00 to 06:00, you'll be notified when they start by SMS to your PDA. While you're a champion, you have full access to all announced fights; that means you can personally decide what to use during the fights and in what order you'll fight in. We still have some rules concerning explosives. Grenades, RG-6's, RPG-7's, Gauss Rifles, and any other heavy weapons are barred. That's pretty much it. The Arena still needs to be cleaned up a little, so you can go to the bar and have a nice drink. Just don't miss the next fight. See you soon, hopefully.</text>

		<text>If you're absolutely sure of your abilities, might I suggest a timed match? These battles usually don't last long and demand some mastery in the art of death. There's a possibility of getting bonuses or even doubling your winnings if you win within the shortest amount of time. Remember one iron rule, you CANNOT kill your opponent after the timer runs out. If you do, you'll be fined the same amount as the winnings. I think you'll agree, it's better to stay with your own ass intact and with no prize than having to pay what you were supposed to win. And I need as many living contestants as possible for the other matches, so you'll be also helping me by following that rule. What do you say? Should I turn on that stopwatch?  </text>

	<string id="aem_military_info">
<!-- MF minor rewrite -->
		<text>The first thing that comes to mind is "What the freaking hell are these guys doing in the bar?". Thanks to their numerous connections, the Dutyers can allow  this for themselves. There aren't many doubts as to the professionalism of these soldiers. They all have alot of experience behind them, which they received even before the Zone appeared. Some of these guys have been in Afghanistan, Georgia, and Chechnya, and they've even spent a few years raiding the Zone, so they're still sharp. They're armed with the best guns their Russian government can produce.</text>

<!-- MF articles -->
		<text>Match with the Mercenaries.</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_killer_info">
<!-- MF minor rewrite</text> -->
		<text>The Mercenaries are a very organized paramilitary group made up of many different private contractors. They carry imported guns, so they're not short on cash. Rumor says that they work for foreign interests and governments, in addition to Russian, Ukrainian, and possibly even Georgian clients. I'd call them a side-effect of Ukraine's government trying so hard to join NATO. Many locals try to keep as far away from them as they can, but to the military, they are like a sharp bone in the throat. They give the mercs the highest priority if they spot them, which kind of makes me respect their soldiers. The firepower of the mercs is hard to ignore, which is why some groupings even have contacts among them.</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_freedom">
		<text>Fight with Freedom.</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_freedom_info">
		<text>Freedomers are the arch enemies of Duty. They have alot of former Dutyers among their ranks, ones that rejected the "we are the last hope of humanity" ideology of that faction. That's one of the reasons why relations between the two factions are very tense, to put it softly. Even though Duty considers Freedom to be nothing more than a gaggle of stoned anarchists, Freedom still put up a hard fight. Freedom is definately more organized than that, and their guns and armor aren't that bad either. Duty had many of their best fighters cross over, so their experience in battle is something to be respected. At the moment, there's a cease-fire between the two factions, but it's pretty shaky.</text>

	<string id="aem_dolg">
		<text>Fight with Duty.</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_dolg_info">
		<text>The Duty faction is our self-declared police force. It's thanks to them that we have fights to the death in our humble arena, in addition to them capturing mutants for me. Members of this faction regularly participate in arena matches to sharpen their skills and practice for future raids into the deepest reaches of the Zone. They are armed with the same gear as our government's Spetsnaz, with the best Warsaw Pact firearms available.</text>
