<text>• Ammunition:\n • .45 ACP FMJ\n • .45 ACP Hydra-Shok\n • Magazine capacity: 30 + 1 rounds\nThe UMP-45 Tactical is a blowback-operated, magazine-fed submachine gun firing from a closed bolt, with integrated silencer and Eotech scope.\nThe UMP-45 is chambered for larger cartridges and magazines than other submachine guns like the 9x19mm MP5,\nto provide greater stopping power against unarmoured targets (albeit with a slightly lower effective range) than the MP5\nA larger cartridge produces more recoil, making control more difficult in full-auto mode. To mitigate this, the cyclic rate of fire was reduced to 600 rounds/min</text>
