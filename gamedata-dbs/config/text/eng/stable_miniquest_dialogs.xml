		<text>Hey, you said, someone left a little of loot for me, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_1">
		<text>Oh... Yea, here it is.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_2">
		<text>Perfect. I'm taking it now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_3">
		<text>Hey, wait a second... No-no, I'm not trying to rob it from you, off course its yours. I kept it safe and you can get it now. By the way, I didnt know, maybe there was something harmful inside, and I'not a very healthy man these days, not like in the old days... So. One hundred for keeping it for you - I think it's a fair deal. OK?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_5">
		<text>Damn, your greed is like a curse! Here, take it "For safe keeping", huh...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_6">
		<text>That's fine. Take you loot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_7">
		<text>Have you lost your mind? You'll give it here now, or I'll speak up about your undercover deals!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_4">
		<text>Damn, I'm empty now. Shall take it after some time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_8">
		<text>Here, take your diamond gift.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_9">
		<text>Ha-ha, you scared me! Who will listen to your words?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_10">
		<text>Newbies in rookies camp. You can be sure, they will buy nothing from you after that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_11">
		<text>The Military!. Guess, what they will do with an illegal trader caught in Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_12">
		<text>My word is not enough! My fist will speak up! Do you want it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_13">
		<text>I got some friends here. Very powerful people, you know...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_14">
		<text>They will buy nothing - others will buy more. This is Zone.\n They can not leave the Zone - soldiers blocked all exits, and for going deeper they will need ammo, weapons... Where can you get those except me? \n So I don't give a shit on what you say to them, got it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_15">
		<text>Ha! Ha-ha! You are really funny guy! I cant laugh enough...\n Where do you think I get all this equipment, all of those arms and ammo? And who do you think is transfering artefacts from the Zone? The Military needs my business more than anyone. \n But you can go there, that's gonna be interesting. I wonder, will they shoot you before you say something, or after...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_16">
		<text>Man, if you are more greedy than me - just say it. I do not like guys who's fists are ahead of words...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_17">
		<text>Remember - friendship ends where big money begins. And I don't care about your friends. Now they are powerful, tomorrow they will be lost - it's Zone, understand?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_18">
		<text>Okay. One hundred - and take your gift.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_19">
		<text>Thank you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_20">
