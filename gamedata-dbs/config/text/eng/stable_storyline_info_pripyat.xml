		<text>The stash contained a short report on how Fang and I infiltrated the underground galleries below the sarcophagus and found a suspicious-looking door. Fang said that he'd put together a decoder for the electronic lock for our next visit. After that we had to run for our lives. There were hordes of Monolith patrols there. Well, I also found the decoder in the stash and directions for finding the door. However, it seems that approaching the Monolith is extremely dangerous - last time we avoided going under the sarcophagus by crawling over the destroyed reactor and it seems that's where the Monolith are now.</text>
