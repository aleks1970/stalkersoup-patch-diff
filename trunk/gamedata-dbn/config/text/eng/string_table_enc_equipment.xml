        <text>You will need several things to successfully transmutate an artefact: \n 1. a Recipe - You must have the recipe for the artifact you're trying to transmute.\n 2. Correct Anomaly - Dropping an artefact in the wrong anomaly won't do anything at all. (See the Encyclopedia of anomalies with descriptions in order to identify the right type)\n 3. Correct artefact - Dropping the wrong type of artefact will also get you nowhere.\n 4. Correct time of day - It must be night time (between 18:00 pm and 06:00) for you to start artefact transmutation. As long as you START before 06:00 am it will work - it doesn't need to finish before 06:00 am ... \n\n For example: you have the recipe for the "Skin" and you want to make it. Look up the "Skin" artefact on the chart and notice the entries under the "Parent artefact", "Parent anomaly", and "Time" headings. Basically, what this means is that if you want to make a "Skin" artefact, open up your inventory and drop a "Pellicle" into a Springboard anomaly and wait four (4) hours. You'll see a bright flash of white light for a second letting you know that the anomaly has accepted the artifact for transmutation ... there you have it.</text>
